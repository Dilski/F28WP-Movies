<h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
<br>
<p> I am creating a Q&A website, and the core functionality that i am
working on is user accounts, which i plan to develop as follows:</p>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>User will be given option to create an account or login</li>
<br>
    
    <li>When creating their account, the user will input information.</li>
<br>
    
    <li>User will have to confirm account creation via email (if the university servers allow)</li>
<br>
    
    <li>The user will be able to log in with their account</li>
<br>
    
    <li>A logged in user will only be able to see information relevent to them</li>
<br>
    
    <li>A user will be able to view their and other's profiles</li>
<br>
    
    <li>A  user can edit their information, including what information they want to be public</li>
<br>
    
</ol>
<br>
<p>
    Please check out the login section, which you can log in using username "Tonya" and password "tiny".
<br>
    You should be able to see that that page shows differently depending on if the user is logged in or not
<br>
    User can only see information once logged in, and can only edit information when logged in
